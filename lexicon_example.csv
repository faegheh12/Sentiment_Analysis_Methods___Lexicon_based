3383,Less than a year into her tenure as chairman of Fidelity Investments   Abigail Johnson faces a crisis amid allegations that the mutual fund giant has a men ’ s club mentality . A sign marks a Fidelity Investments office in Boston   Massachusetts   U . S . September 21   2016 . REUTERS / Brian Snyder - Johnson is addressing inappropriate workplace conduct such as sexual harassment by hiring a consulting firm to review employee behavior stretching back years   the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday . “ Fidelity ’ s policies specifically prohibit harassment in any form  ” the company said in a statement on Sunday . “ When allegations of these sorts are brought to our attention   we investigate them immediately and take prompt and appropriate action .” Fidelity would not confirm the review by consultants . In the past month   Johnson collared the attention of Fidelity ’ s stock funds team when she signed off on the dismissal of star portfolio manager Gavin Baker   who had been accused of sexual harassment   according to a person familiar with the situation . The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the circumstances surrounding Baker ’ s departure on Oct . 13 . Through a spokeswoman at public relations firm Goldin Solutions   Baker has denied allegations of sexual harassment . Brian Hogan   president of Fidelity ’ s stock funds division   held an emergency meeting on Oct . 16 to ensure everyone is aware of the company ’ s zero - tolerance policy for inappropriate conduct   according to a source familiar with the meeting . He also reiterated that employees have various ways   such as calling the chairman ’ s hotline   to report any concerns anonymously . He called the meeting partly to address concerns raised in connection with the ouster of Baker   who ran the $ 16 billion OTC ( over the counter ) Portfolio . He had one of the hottest hands in the mutual fund industry   generating a 3 - year annualized return of 19 . 03 percent   or better than 99 percent of his large - cap growth fund peers   according to Morningstar . The Wall Street Journal was the first to report Hogan ’ s meeting in a Sunday story that also said Fidelity had dismissed  Robert Chow    who had been with the money manager for nearly 30 years . A person familiar with the situation confirmed the report that  Chow  had been forced out after being accused of making inappropriate sexual comments . Chow   who was known as a value investor earlier in his career   had most recently worked as a senior investment manager for private portfolios . He did not return messages seeking comment . Fidelity ’ s handling of the claims coincides with a deluge of sexual harassments complaints against powerful executives in the entertainment industry that has opened a fierce debate about workplace abuse of women in the wider world . Johnson recently said she is on a mission to hire more women at Fidelity . Last month   she said Fidelity had a shortage of women to give financial advice to female clients at its investment branches . “ We have a real need in our business to recruit more women  ” Johnson said in a September interview on Bloomberg TV . “... We don ’ t have enough women who are customer facing reps to serve all the women customers who come in and ask for women .”,Negative

3385,Mark Janus is a child support specialist for the state of Illinois who   like many Illinoisans   has some disagreements with the policies of the American Federation of State   County and Municipal Employees . Most Illinoisans   however   are not required to pay dues to the union . Though he has chosen not to join AFSCME   Janus is nonetheless required under Illinois law to pay fees to the union that represents state workers . He would like to stop doing so   rather than support positions and activities that conflict with his views . And the U . S . Supreme Court   which heard oral arguments in the case Monday   looks inclined to let him . Those state employees who decline to join the union are exempt from that portion of dues that go to finance its political action . But they are forced to pay “ fair share ” fees that supposedly reflect the benefit they get from the union ’ s collective bargaining . The rationale is that if workers could opt out of any payments   those doing so would be “ free riders ”: They would reap the pay and conditions the union negotiates — while paying members bear the union ’ s costs . There are obvious problems with AFSCME ’ s argument for compulsory fees . The first is that the union has the discretion to decide what counts as political spending and what doesn ’ t . Janus ’ lawyers note that these claims “ turn   to a large degree   on self - interested judgments by union officials about how they and other union employees spend their time .” More basic   though   is that when a union negotiates on behalf of public workers   everything it does is inherently political . When AFSCME pushes for higher wages or changes in work rules   it is putting itself on one side of a political issue . In a parallel case from California two years ago    Chief Justice John Roberts  asked the lawyer for the state to name a topic of collective bargaining that has nothing to do with such matters . When  he  cited “ mileage reimbursements  ”  Roberts  disagreed : “ It ’ s all money . If you give more mileage expenses ( to teachers )  the amount that ’ s going to be allocated to public education as opposed to public housing   welfare benefits — that ’ s always a public policy issue .” Mandatory fees require dissenting nonmembers to support beliefs they reject . But the right of free speech   as the court long has recognized   includes the freedom not to speak . To force someone to pay for the advancement of political positions without his or her consent is incompatible with the First Amendment . Union officials say losing the revenue from compelled payments would weaken their negotiating power . But they also fear losing   yes   political power . AFSCME ’ s Naomi Walker has warned that a loss in this case “ could undermine political operations that assist the Democratic Party ” and damage “ the progressive infrastructure in this country   from think tanks to advocacy organizations .” But why should the needs of union - aligned groups take precedence over Janus ’ right to decide which causes to financially support ? What if Illinois law required certain workers to contribute to groups that provide useful services but also donate heavily to Republican causes ? Writing in the Tribune two years ago   Janus argued   “ Government unions have pushed for government spending that made the state ’ s fiscal situation worse . How is that good for the people of the state ? Or   for that matter   my fellow union members who face the threat of layoffs or their pension funds someday running dry ?” For Janus to win   the court would probably have to overrule a 1977 decision that upheld such fees . The justices came close in the 2016 California case   shortly after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia   deadlocking 4 - 4 . The addition of conservative Neil Gorsuch seems likely to provide the deciding vote for the reversal here . In 2014   the Supreme Court said that “ except in perhaps the rarest of circumstances   no person in this country may be compelled to subsidize speech by a third party that he or she does not wish to support .” This case is a chance for the justices to say : And we mean it . Why I don ' t want to pay union dues » Why am I paying union dues when the union won ’ t protect me from sexual harassment ? Rauner says Illinois falls short on job creation .

3388,"evident   would you and your neighbors see eye to eye ? That ’ s the question "" The American Question "" ( produced by  Guy Seemann  and directed by James Kicklighter ) is intended to answer when it hits the festival circuit this year . The documentary film challenges Americans to stop blaming others about the current social and political climate and to question how their own decisions and actions shape the country . The film has taken  Seemann  and Kicklighter around the nation to ask questions about family   money and civics with the objective of getting viewers to consider whether divisions in our society stem from group dynamics or if we ' re all part of the problem as individuals . In a series of interviews   the film features dozens of Americans from across political   economic and social spectrums . A teaser for the production was released in November 2017 . From  director James Kicklighter and political scientist Guy Seemann  comes the story of a values crisis in America   the start of a national conversation about the effort to re - estab ... From  director James Kicklighter and political scientist Guy Seemann  comes the story of a values crisis in America   the start of a national conversation about the effort to re - estab ... SEE MORE VIDEOS “ American values are written down in the founding documents : the Constitution   Declaration of Independence   ” Seemann  said . “ Those values — concepts of opportunity and equality   different types of freedoms   concepts of hard work and the American dream … those are concepts they defined then and we still talk about today . Now   the real question is how are people defining those values for themselves today ? Are they defining them in the context that the founders had   or are people redefining them to the point where they see someone else as an enemy of those values ?” People exist now in their own bubbles of isolation   where it ’ s much easier for folks to peg others as enemies because “ we ’ re only listening to things   finding things and sharing things that only substantiate what we already believe  ” Kicklighter said . To break out of these bubbles   the duo believe   the majority of Americans need to agree and adhere to a baseline of values they think are the same as those of their neighbors . “ The American Question ” is that wake - up call to the country   said Seemann — a “ cautionary tale ” to the masses to not regress   but to progress . Kicklighter and Seemann use values as the foundation that joins individuals and community together . Less individual mindset   more connection . Less division   more community . “ Once you agree that you share the same value system with your neighbor   that ’ s when you actually see progress   that ’ s when you have mutual respect   and the community comes back together  ” Seemann said . “ If you can convince people this is a national concept   that everyone is pretty much in the same boat — that ’ s when you won ’ t want to be in your own bubble . You will challenge your own perspective and negative viewpoints .” The documentary team doesn ’ t consider its film revolutionary . Seemann and Kicklighter said academics like Robert Putnam   author of “ Bowling Alone  ” and Charles Murray   author of “ Coming Apart  ” have been foreshadowing the current political and social climate for years   but Kicklighter and Seeman are making a film with the hope that it will reach more eyes . After the film is completed this year   the pair would like a theatrical release in smaller locales as well as larger ones . The goal is to have enough of an impact   by melding data and emotion   to start a national conversation   Seemann and Kicklighter said . “ It is really tough to get more than 300 million people pointed in one direction and on the same page   but the value system continues to push us in the right direction  ” Seemann said . “ We want people to recognize ( what needs to be done ): Secure the founding values   execute them more properly . We all need to believe in this concept of freedom and equality for everyone   to move forward — we ’ ve been doing it incrementally for hundreds of years   so let ’ s keep pushing .” Kicklighter agrees . “ If you push the needle a little bit   that can make a positive impact on society  ” he said . “ My hope with this film is to give the audience an opportunity to maybe change the way their thought process is ( just an inch )  so they can hear someone else .” drockett @ chicagotribune . com Twitter @ DarcelTribune Related : ' Unrest ' puts spotlight on disease that affects millions   including Riverside girl   12 » After traveling around U .

3389,"What Went Wrong In Charlottesville ? Almost Everything   Says Report Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Updated at 6 : 30 p . m . ET An independent review of Charlottesville ' s handling of the white nationalist rally there in August found that law enforcement and city officials made several significant mistakes   resulting in violence and distrust . The city commissioned the report   which was prepared by  Timothy Heaphy    a former U . S . attorney in Virginia . In conducting the investigation    Heaphy  said  his  team pored through hundreds of thousands of documents   interviewed hundreds of witnesses   and reviewed countless hours of video and audio . The resulting 220 - page report is a detailed record of the chaos and conflict that unspooled in the Virginia college town . It is unsparing in identifying the errors authorities made that day and in the preceding months . The city failed to protect either free expression or public safety   the report finds : "" This represents a failure of one of government ' s core functions — the protection of fundamental rights . Law enforcement also failed to maintain order and protect citizens from harm   injury   and death . Charlottesville preserved neither of those principles on August 12   which has led to deep distrust of government within this community ."" The "" most tragic manifestation "" of the failure to protect public safety was the death of 32 - year - old Heather Heyer   the report says . "" Early on August 12   CPD had placed a school resource officer alone at the intersection of 4th Street NE and Market Street  "" the report explains . "" This officer feared for her safety as groups of angry Alt - Right protesters and counter - protesters streamed by her as they left Emancipation Park . The officer called for assistance and was relieved of her post . Unfortunately   CPD commanders did not replace her or make other arrangements to prevent traffic from traveling across the Downtown Mall on 4th Street ."" All that remained to impede traffic was a single wooden sawhorse . "" This vulnerability was exposed when James Fields drove his vehicle down the unprotected street into a large crowd of counter - protesters at the intersection of 4th Street SE and Water Street   killing Ms . Heyer  "" it says . The report praised the city ' s fire department and the University of Virginia Health System for their quick response to victims of the car attack   calling it "" a bright success on a day largely filled with failure ."" Some of the problems identified in the report echo the criticism of law enforcement response at the time ; some are new revelations . Among the mistakes : Attempts in the days before the protest to move the event to a different location meant that law enforcement had to plan for two scenarios . Charlottesville Police and Virginia State Police did not sufficiently coordinate their plans . On August 12   their officers could not communicate over the radio with one another because they were on different channels . Police did not adequately separate conflicting groups   which led to physical altercations . Police commanders instructed their officers not to intervene in all but the most serious physical confrontations . They prepared to respond to violence by declaring an unlawful assembly and dispersing the crowd . Once unlawful assembly was declared   police efforts to disperse the crowd generated more violence   as conflicting groups were pushed toward each other . Officers remained behind barricades in relatively empty areas   rather than being stationed along crucial routes as protesters and counterprotesters shifted and clashed . Tactical gear wasn ' t accessible when officers needed it . Charlottesville Police received inaccurate information from Commonwealth ' s Attorney Dave Chapman regarding the legality of restricting weapons other than firearms . Chapman told police they could not restrict other weapons   when in fact the city could have prohibited bats   poles and shields . In a statement to NPR   Charlottesville City Manager Maurice Jones said that the city does "" not agree with every aspect of the report ' s findings  "" but it is thankful for the work of the reviewers . "" We faced an unprecedented series of protests and demonstrations this summer   culminating with the Unite the Right Rally on August 12th  "" Jones said . "" On a number of fronts   as the report acknowledges   we succeeded in protecting our City to the best of our abilities . But in other areas we   and our law enforcement partner in the Virginia State Police   undoubtedly fell short of expectations   and for that we are profoundly sorry . This report is one critical step in helping this community heal and move forward after suffering through this summer of hate ."" Police Chief Al Thomas Jr . released a statement saying   "" My hope now is that   as we move forward ... we can learn from the productive elements of this report   work together to address our shortcomings and recommit ourselves to serving the public in a way that gives our citizens the utmost confidence in their safety and wellbeing ."" After documenting what went wrong   the report also had a number of recommendations for Charlottesville and other municipalities that need to prepare for similar "" mass unrest events .""

3390,"Volunteers In NYC Show Support For Immigrants At Court Appearances   Appointments A new type of volunteer opportunity has taken off in New York City . Hundreds of people are going with immigrants to court appearances and appointments with immigration officials . With President Trump ' s crackdown on illegal immigration   they want to show solidarity   and be a friendly support system . ROBERT SIEGEL   HOST : A new type of volunteer opportunity has taken off in New York City . Hundreds of people are going with immigrants to court appearances and appointments with immigration officials . With President Trump ' s crackdown on illegal immigration   the volunteers want to show solidarity . WNYC ' s Beth Fertig brings us this story . OK   tell me your name . BETH FERTIG   BYLINE : On a recent weekday morning   Marissa Lohse is gathering her troops in a coffeeshop in lower Manhattan . LOHSE : Perfect   perfect . FERTIG : Lohse is with the New Sanctuary Coalition . It ' s a network of congregations and individuals who accompany immigrants facing deportation to the Federal Building   which is just down the street .  Jean Hale  is a first - time volunteer .  She  doesn ' t know what to expect .  HALE  : I think it may be just emotional support and perhaps a big hug . FERTIG :  Hale  says  she  ' s horrified by the Trump administration ' s aggressive enforcement of immigration laws .  She  ' s 73   a retired English as a Second Language teacher . The volunteer program took off in 2010 during a previous crackdown under former President Obama . But Lohse - herself an immigrant from Argentina - says it ' s now bigger than ever . Several hundred volunteers came forward after Trump took office . A lot are retirees like her . They call the immigrants   friends . LOHSE : Before   I was just going by myself with a friend . Now it ' s just   thank God we have so many volunteers . So I do it   and I cry when I think about it . FERTIG : There ' s a lot on the line . These volunteers are joining people at immigration court hearings to determine whether they can stay in the country . Others are bringing them to check - ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement . Many undocumented immigrants were allowed to stay as long as they regularly met with ICE . These check - ins used to be routine . Now   some immigrants are detained without any warning . Lohse has seen that firsthand . LOHSE : I ' ve been one time when I was with a wife of a guy . Then   the ICE agent came out with a pair of glasses and a wallet . Your husband wants you to have this . They didn ' t give a chance for her to say goodbye . FERTIG : This type of volunteering is not easy . It ' s emotional   and the issues are thorny . At a training session   volunteers are told all immigrants deserve support   even those who have committed crimes . That gave one man pause . ED STUBIN : I can accept that the criminal justice system isn ' t always right   but I ' m troubled having to go with some people that I don ' t think should be on this earth   much less in this country . FERTIG : That ' s Ed Stubin   a business owner who says his father was an immigrant . He decides he will volunteer   however   when a coordinator assures him that immigrants who commit serious crimes are usually held in detention . On the day of the coffeehouse meeting   about 40 volunteers are joining eight immigrants . One of those immigrants is Inez   a young mother seeking asylum who doesn ' t want us using her full name . She ' s got her 3 - year - old son with her   and she ' s grateful to have six of the volunteers going with her to immigration court . INEZ : ( Foreign language spoken ). FERTIG : The group includes  Jean Hale   the retired teacher and first - time volunteer  .  They  spent four hours in the waiting room outside court . Mostly    they  played with Inez ' s toddler . Finally   Inez had her hearing . The judge gave her three more months to find a lawyer . Afterward   outside the federal building    Hale  said some undocumented immigrants deserve to stay .  HALE  : I would like to see our laws changed so that people could remain who have come to our country . FERTIG :  Hale  also said  she  ' ll continue to volunteer .

3392,"' I Came   I Saw   I Selfied ': How Instagram Transformed The Way We Experience Art Enlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski / AFP / Getty Images Brendan Smialowski / AFP / Getty Images You are suspended in an endless dark chamber as thousands of red   green   yellow and blue lights flicker across the air like tiny diamonds in the sky . Or at least that ' s how it appears in the selfie you just posted on Instagram . Yayoi Kusama ' s "" Infinity Mirrors "" – mirror - lined rooms that seem to go on forever – is part of the latest art craze to take over social media . Immersive exhibits are driving people to museums in search of the perfect snapshot . Arielle Pardes   senior associate editor of technology and culture at Wired   tells Here & Now ' s Jeremy Hobson that the explosion of "" made - for - Instagram "" art exhibits is creating a market for art that is intended to be reinterpreted by people online . "" You can sort of skip that whole first part where you have an artistic process and an artistic critique of something   and just go straight to the selfie by building a space that exists primarily for replication online  "" she says . In a TED Talk last year on "" Art in the Age of Instagram  "" JiaJia Fei   director of digital at the Jewish Museum of New York   highlights the ascendance of "" Instagrammable "" exhibitions since the social media platform launched in 2010 . "" You think of Yayoi Kusama and her Infinity Mirrored Room ... and then artists like James Turrell or the Rain Room at MoMA  "" she said in the TED Talk . "" These are artists who really have very critical bodies of work   but [ created installations ] that have taken on new meaning because of social media ."" Many of the masterminds behind these exhibits admit that creating social - media - worthy art was a key goal . In San Francisco   the 12   000 - square - foot Color Factory features a pit filled with 207   000 plastic yellow balls   a giant Lite - Brite game and a life - size coloring book . "" Our goal was that every exhibit be three things  "" founder Jordan Ferney told the San Francisco Chronicle . "" It would be conceptual ; very photogenic and do well on social media ; and be an experience that you couldn ' t get anywhere else ."" Across the country in Washington   D . C .  the interactive "" sensory art experiences "" at Artechouse seem tailor - made for Instagram . But the art and technology museum ' s founders deny social media played a role in their process   despite the fact the museum has been tagged in more than 25   000 Instagram posts since it opened in June . "" There are people who would like to come tell a story  "" Artechouse co - founder Tati Pastukhova told The Washington Post in November   somewhat acknowledging Instagram as a main driver for the museum ' s more than 65   000 visitors . The deeply engaging quality of this art lends itself to social media because it allows the viewer to have a stake in the artistic process   Pardes says . "" Part of it has to do with the fact that these exhibits are very very immersive   so you can go to it  "" she says . "" And rather than just sort of staring at a piece of art on the wall   you actually become a part of the art ."" While the hunt for the perfect Instagram photo is driving a lot of people into art museums   Pardes says some museum curators argue that can distract from thinking critically about art . "" If you ' re expecting that you go into this space and you get a great photo ... and you get to show people that you were there   then maybe that ' s not exactly what the artist had intended  "" she says .  Pardes  also argues the art in these exhibits takes on a different meaning when  it  is blurred by commercial interests . Before the New York location of the Museum of Ice Cream closed for the season earlier this year   30 sponsors paid to have their brands featured . "" Tinderland  "" a section of the exhibit sponsored by the dating app Tinder   prompted people to discover their "" true flavor match ."" This potential divide among artists and consumers illustrates how social media has influenced our behavior . Pardes says even restaurants and retail spaces are redesigning their spaces to make them more appealing for social media . "" In the pre - digital photography era   the message was : This is what I ' m seeing . I have seen  "" Fei said in her TED Talk . "" Today   the message was : I was there . I came   I saw   and I selfied .""",Positive
3393,The Harvey Weinsteins of the world aren ' t always household names . Frequently   in fact   they ' re nothing of the sort . So it is with  James Toback    a longtime ( and relatively obscure ) filmmaker who is now facing allegations of sexual harassment leveled by 38 different women   as a Los Angeles Times investigation reveals . And much like Weinstein   Toback ' s deplorable behavior has been an open secret for decades . He was the subject of an extensive feature in a 1989 issue Spy Magazine   which chronicled firsthand accounts from an assortment of ( anonymous ) women . More recently   his bad behavior was highlighted in four different Gawker stories   published between 2008 and 2012 . Now there ' s this LA Times feature   in which 31 of the 38 women interviewed opted to speak on the record . It ' s a long and detailed read   filled with account after account of  Toback  ' s vile behavior over the years . Spy Magazine ran a very revealing piece about  James Toback  way back in March 1989 . For years   it was missing from the defunct magazine ' s records . You can read it here at the following site ( pages 86 to 92 )... # jamestoback # spymagazine https :// t . co / NQCbKRn1bJ pic . twitter . com / iTLOfrlsqb — Richard Luck (@ RMGLUCK2017 ) October 22   2017 It ' s not an easy story to read   and it ' s not supposed to be . But men especially should set aside the time to take in every word . We can all do better to shut down the gender inequality that ' s an inescapable aspect of our day - to - day lives   and processing ugly stories like this is an important step in that process . If there ' s any silver lining to draw from the Weinstein mess   it ' s that victims of sexual predators are increasingly finding the courage to come forward and name names .  Toback  is only the latest figure to be outed in a domino - like series of them that spans multiple industries and fields of work . It ' s a sad truth that so many of these stories go back as far as they do — especially with guys like  Toback  and Weinstein   where it ' s literally decades — but the one - after - another fall that ' s currently playing out all around us is a hopeful sign for a looming change that actually sticks . We see you now    James Toback  .,Negative

3396,The head of the U . S . Federal Communications Commission unveiled plans on Tuesday to repeal landmark 2015 rules that prohibited internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content in a move that promises to recast the digital landscape .  FCC chief Ajit Pai   a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump in January    said the commission will vote at a Dec . 14 meeting on  his  plan to rescind the so - called net neutrality rules championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama that treated internet service providers like public utilities . The rules barred broadband providers from blocking or slowing down access to content or charging consumers more for certain content . They were intended to ensure a free and open internet   give consumers equal access to web content and prevent broadband service providers from favoring their own content . The action marks a victory for big internet service providers such as AT & T Inc   Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc that opposed the rules and gives them sweeping powers to decide what web content consumers can get and at what price . It represents a setback for Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc   which had urged Pai not to rescind the rules . Netflix said Tuesday it opposed the measure to “ roll back these core protections .” With three Republican and two Democratic commissioners   the move is all but certain to be approved . Trump   a Republican   expressed his opposition to net neutrality in 2014 before the regulations were even implemented   calling it a “ power grab ” by Obama . The White House did not immediately comment Tuesday .  Pai  said  his  proposal would prevent state and local governments from creating their own net neutrality rules because internet service is “ inherently an interstate service .” The preemption is most likely to handcuff Democratic - governed states and localities that could have considered their own plans to protect consumers ’ equal access to internet content . “ The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and preemptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro - competitive  ”  Pai  said in an interview   adding that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised “ heavy - handed ” regulation of the internet . “ We should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses  ”  Pai  added . Tom Wheeler   who headed the FCC under Obama and advocated for the net neutrality rules   called the planned repeal “ a shameful sham and sellout . Even for this FCC and its leadership   this proposal raises hypocrisy to new heights .” AT & T   Comcast and Verizon have said that repealing the rules could lead to billions of dollars in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility that a future presidential administration could regulate internet pricing . Comcast said no matter what the FCC decided it would “ not block   throttle   or discriminate against lawful content .” ‘ HEAVY COSTS ’ Verizon said it believed the FCC “ will reinstate a framework that protects consumers ’ access to the open internet   without forcing them to bear the heavy costs from unnecessary regulation .” Ajit Pai   Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission   testifies before a Senate Appropriations Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee on Capitol Hill in Washington   U . S .  June 20   2017 . REUTERS / Aaron P . Bernstein The Internet Association   representing major technology firms including Alphabet and Facebook   said Pai ’ s proposal “ represents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans .” “ This proposal undoes nearly two decades of bipartisan agreement on baseline net neutrality principles that protect Americans ’ ability to access the entire internet  ” it said . Pai ’ s proposal would require internet service providers to disclose whether they allow blocking or slowing down of consumer web access or permit so - called internet fast lanes to facilitate a practice called paid prioritization of charging for certain content . Such disclosure will make it easier for another agency   the Federal Trade Commission   to act against internet service providers that fail to disclose such conduct to consumers   Pai said . The FTC could seek to bar practices that it deemed “ anticompetitive ” or violated antitrust rules . The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) logo is seen before the FCC Net Neutrality hearing in Washington February 26   2015 . REUTERS / Yuri Gripas The FCC received more than 22 million comments . New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman disclosed Tuesday he has been investigating for more than six months in a bid to learn who was behind the filing of false comments . A U . S . appeals court last year upheld the legality of the net neutrality regulations   which were challenged in a lawsuit led by telecommunications industry trade association US Telecom . The group praised Pai ’ s decision to remove “ antiquated   restrictive regulations ” to “ pave the way for broadband network investment   expansion and upgrades .” The FCC ’ s repeal is certain to draw a legal challenge from advocates of net neutrality . Nancy Pelosi   the top U . S . House of Representatives Democrat   said the FCC move would hurt consumers and chill competition   saying the agency “ has launched an all - out assault on the entrepreneurship   innovation and competition at the heart of the internet .” The planned repeal represents the latest example of a legacy achievement of Obama being erased since Trump took office in January . Trump has abandoned international trade deals   the landmark Paris climate accord and environmental protections   taken aim at the Iran nuclear accord and closer relations with Cuba   and sought repeal Obama ’ s signature healthcare law . Pai   who has moved quickly to undo numerous regulatory actions since becoming FCC chairman   is pushing a broad deregulatory agenda . Pai said he had not shared his plans on the rollback with the White House in advance or been directed to undo net neutrality by White House officials . The FCC under Obama regulated internet service providers like public utilities under a section of federal law that gave the agency sweeping oversight over the conduct of these companies . Language in the new proposal would give the FCC significantly less authority to oversee the web . The FCC granted initial approval to Pai ’ s plan in May   but had left open many key questions including whether to retain any legal requirements limiting internet providers conduct . His plan would eliminate the “ internet conduct standard  ” which gave the FCC far - reaching discretion to prohibit improper internet service provider practices .,Neutral

3399,A federal judge in Chicago says the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago must pay $ 700   000 to a former employee who said she was fired for complaining another employee was viewing pornography on a church computer .

A lawyer for the archdiocese says it will appeal .  Sanchez  worked as a parish assistant in 2014 .  She  says archdiocese records wrongly indicated the tech - support worker was looking at women in swimsuits .

3400,The U . S . Justice Department will extend greater leniency to companies that voluntarily alert authorities when they learn employees have paid bribes to foreign officials   Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said on Wednesday . FILE PHOTO : The exterior of the U . S . Department of Justice headquarters building in Washington   DC   U . S . on July 14   2009 . REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst / File Photo The new guidelines will allow most companies to avoid prosecution altogether if they fully disclose foreign bribery   cooperate in the investigation and take steps to avoid future misconduct    Rosenstein  said at a Maryland legal conference . This will prompt greater corporate cooperation with authorities    he  said . “ We want corporate officers and board members to better understand the costs and benefits of cooperation .” The changes come at a time when U . S . Attorney General Jeff Sessions has asked prosecutors to take a tougher line against criminals   particularly in drug cases . The guidelines expand a pilot program   launched in 2016 by the Obama administration   to encourage more companies to come forward when they discover foreign bribery   in exchange for lighter penalties . The U . S . Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it a crime for companies to bribe overseas officials to win business . While the previous program allowed for no prosecution   the new rules offer the “ presumption ” that charges will be dropped if companies come forward and fully cooperate .  Rosenstein  said that because corporate crimes are ultimately committed by people   not firms   companies should not be prosecuted by the same standard . “ It makes sense to treat corporations differently than individuals  ”  he  said . In cases when the misconduct is so severe that the Justice Department cannot drop charges   the guidelines will still allow companies that come forward to get a 50 percent reduction of the lowest level of penalty . But the requirements that companies must meet for prosecutors to drop charges will be “ rigorous ” and give authorities more ammunition to pursue individual executives involved in the crimes   senior Justice Department officials told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday . “ I don ’ t think it ’ s accurate at all to portray or understand this policy as giving a pass to corporate crime  ” a U . S . Justice Department official said .,Neutral
